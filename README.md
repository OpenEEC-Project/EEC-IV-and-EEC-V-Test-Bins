# EEC-IV-and-EEC-V-Test-Bins
BIN files and supporting files for testing function of 8061 and 8065 processors.

The BIN files are intended to be loaded on a Moates Quarterhorse and run on 8065 hardware, but they can be run on 8061 hardware as well.
The definition files may be loaded in Binary Editor and logging enabled to observe the effect of certain address modes.

The DIR and CMT files are configured for SAD4.07.1 or SAD4.07.12. LST output for both SAD versions is included.

Log files are included to show the results of running the BINs on P3M and VILE catchcodes.

These are intended for educational purposes. Use them at your own risk.
